Code for paper exploring link between psychopathology and processing speed

This repository contains code used to clean and analyze data from the [Healthy Brain Network](https://childmind.org/science/global-open-science/healthy-brain-network/) biobank, specifically exploring relationships between processing speed, mental health disorders, and learning disorders using principal component analysis and multiple linear regression. Datasets not included.

`clean_data.R` contains the code to organize and clean all assessment data, and `PS_analysis.R` contains code to generate results used in manuscript [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-66892-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-66892-z), including those that did not make it into the final draft.
